<h2>The Logo</h2>
Since the purpose of my manual was the construction of replacement viper fighters and the training of
new pilots to man them, it was fitting to name my  hypothetical organization the "Air Group Development Team". 
I wanted to make the team and logo seem realistic for the Galactica universe, and as such I drew inspiration
from the in-universe pilot's wings. I took the overall shape of the pilot's wings, and taking inspiration from 
other military insignia and patches, created two white banner fields around the symbol to contain text.
<br></br>

<TABLE align=center border=0>
    <tr>
        <td valign=top>
            <img src="galacticaPilotWings.jpg" width=300>
        </td>
        <td valign=top>
            <img src="englLogo.png" width=300>
        </td>
    </tr>
</TABLE>

<br>
I also really liked the idea of the chevrons inside of the in-universe pilot's wings, so I drew up some similar shapes to place 
in my team logo as well. I like to think that they symbolize positive, upward progress. The color scheme was a complete rip-off from 
NASA, and while Galactica generally uses mostly earth-toned color schemes, there are instances of brighter colors being used for things 
like the squadron patches on some character's flight suits.
<br></br>
Below the three chevrons is a vector art of a phoenix. Being from Atlanta (our city seal has a phoenix on it, referencing Sherman's march to the sea and burning of
Atlanta during the American Civil War) I instantly thought of a phoenix when creating my hypothetical organization, as it symbolizes rebirth from the ashes, much like Galactica's 
situation in the series.

<h2>The Mission Statement</h2>
Any good organization needs a mission statement to guide it. Here's what I came up with:
<br></br>
<table align=center border=3 cellpadding=10>
    <tr>
        <td valign=top>
<pre>
In the crucible of the cosmos, where hope contends with the void, the Air Group
Development Team (AGDT) emerges as a beacon of resilience. Established by order of
Commander Adama and in collaboration with numerous elements of the Colonial Fleet,
AGDT stands as a vanguard of innovation, tasked with the responsibility of crafting the next
generation of fighter spacecraft and the training of the valiant pilots who will wield them for
the protection of humanity.
<br>
This manual serves a dual purpose: guiding the construction of next generation spacecraft
and facilitating the training of skilled pilots. We are committed to surpassing the capabilities
of the Viper MK II, providing a crucial edge in the ongoing battle against the Cylons.
Within these pages, we embark on an innovative journey. With precise instructions,
advanced materials, and visionary design, we breathe life into the fighter spacecraft of the
future. Our team tirelessly pushes boundaries, elevating our fighters beyond their
predecessors.
<br>
AGDT also recognizes that a spacecraft's heart lies in its pilot. This manual seeks to
cultivate elite aviators, instilling in them the skills, resilience, and tactical acumen needed for
success in the unforgiving expanse of space. We will forge fearless warriors ready to face
any challenge.
<br>
With unwavering determination and boundless ingenuity, we will prevail. Our fighters will
conquer the void, our pilots embodying courage, and our triumphs echoing through history.
With resolute purpose, we embark on this noble mission, knowing our destiny is entwined
with that of all humanity. Together, we soar toward a future where the human spirit prevails
against the shadows that seek to extinguish our light.</pre>

I should also be noted I used ChatGPT in the initial stages of writing this mission statement. I prompted 
it with the same premise I gave above, and asked it to write a 200-300 word mission statement accordingly. 
I had to change quite a bit, as the output it gave sounded very corporate and not appropriate for a military 
organization at all. Additionally, it got quite a few details wrong, mainly the in-universe context that inspired 
the creation of my organization in the first place.
