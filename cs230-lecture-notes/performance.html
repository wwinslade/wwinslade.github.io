<h2>Introduction</h2>
As computer scientists, we always want to design programs and software with efficiency and performance in mind. 
A big part of this is time complexity (Big-O) when dealing with CS on a High Level Language basis, but when it comes 
to Assembly there are some other metrics we like to use.
<br>

<h2>Factors Affecting Performance</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The algorithm you implement</li>
    <li>Programming language, compiler, and architecture</li>
    <li>Processor and memory structure</li>
    <li>I/O systems, including the OS</li>
</ul>
These are all self explanatory. Generally, we mostly affect performance through algorithm design and data structure choices.

<h2>Measuring Performance</h2>
We can break down most performance metrics into two kinds of categories.
