<h2>Introduction</h2>
As computer scientists, we always want to design programs and software with efficiency and performance in mind. 
A big part of this is time complexity (Big-O) when dealing with CS on a High Level Language basis, but when it comes 
to Assembly there are some other metrics we like to use.
<br>
<hr>
<h2>Factors Affecting Performance</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The algorithm you implement</li>
    <li>Programming language, compiler, and architecture</li>
    <li>Processor and memory structure</li>
    <li>I/O systems, including the OS</li>
</ul>
These are all self explanatory. Generally, we mostly affect performance through algorithm design and data structure choices.
<br></br>
<h2>Measuring Performance</h2>
We can break down most performance metrics into two kinds of categories:
<ul>
    <li>Response Time related metrics</li>
    <li>Throughput related metrics</li>
</ul>
<i>Response time</i> is how long it takes a machine to execute and complete a given task (e.g. program <i>y</i> takes <i>k</i> seconds to 
execute on a given machine), and <i>throughput</i> is described as total work done per unit of time (for example, calculations per second, etc.).
<h3>Response Time</h3>
If we define performance as the inverse of the execution time of a program, then it becomes easy to compare the performance of two objects. A 
common way of comparing the performance of two things is saying that <i>X</i> is <i>n</i> times faster than <i>Y</i>. We can calculate this:

<h3>Measuring Execution Time</h3>
Execution time is measured in two main ways, <i>real-time</i> and <i>CPU time</i>. <i>Real time</i>, also referred to as "clock time", is the literal 
amount of time that passes between calling a program and it finishing. <i>CPU time</i> is the time the processor takes to complete a given job, and doesn't 
include I/O time, or the time the CPU will spend doing other jobs while a given program is being executed. CPU execution time is usually slightly 
smaller than real time execution time. 
<br></br> 
There is also a third, but less useful measurement of execution time, <i>OS time</i>. This is time the operating system 
spends calling the program, loading instructions, allocating memory, and cleaning up after the program is done. It usually makes up a fraction of the 
clock execution time of a program, will vary greatly between different programs and different systems, and isn't really a useful measurement 
of the performance of a program.
<h3>CPU Clocking and Time</h3>
Everything a CPU does revolves around its clock. A CPU clock refers to how many cycles it performs in a given time frame, usually measured in Hz. For example, 
modern processors are usually clocked between 3.2 GHz and 4.2 GHz, with the speed changing depending on the workload the processor is under. Logically, it is 
more power efficient for a CPU to have a lower clock speed when at idle, so modern processors take advantage of this and throttle up or down their clocks depending 
on demand. For simplicity's sake, we will usually assume the clock rate of a CPU to be constant in this class.
<br></br>
We can use the above to our advantage. CPU time can be represented as the product of the number clock cycles and the time it takes to complete one clock cycle, or as the quotient 
of the number of clock cycles and the clock rate. 
<br></br>
For example, say on Computer <i>A</i>, we have a CPU with a 2GHz clock, and program <i>X</i> takes 10 seconds to execute on it. If we 
want to design a CPU for Computer <i>B</i> so that program <i>X</i> will take 6 seconds to execute, what does the clock rate of CPU <i>B</i>
need to be? We can easily find this:
<br></br>

<h3>Instruction Count and CPI</h3>
Two more important metrics of the performance of a system are the instruction count and cycles-per-instruction (CPI):
<br><br>
<b>Instruction Count</b> is the literal number of assembly instructions that are required to execute a given program. This depends 
on the <i>Instruction Set Architecture</i> of a processor, which will change from system to system (we will use the ARM instruction 
set LEGv8 in this class).
<br></br>
<b>CPI</b> is the number of CPU cycles required to complete a particular instruction. This will be determined by the CPU's architecture, clock rate, and other 
hardware implementation choices, and will vary from instruction to instruction. Some will require one cycle, others will require many more. For the purposes of calculating 
performance, we will usually take the average CPI value of an entire program rather than focusing on any particular instruction.
<br></br>
Often for this class, you will be given something like:
<ul>
    <li>A program has three classes of instructions, A, B, and C</li>
    <li>20% of instructions for a program are class A, 40% are class B, and 40% are class C</li>
    <li>Class A instructions take 1 cycle to execute, Class B takes 2, and Class C takes 3</li>
    <li>What is the average CPI for the program?</li>
    <li>How many clock cycles are needed to execute the program?</li>
    <li>If a CPU runs at 1 MHz, how long will it take to execute the program?</li>
</ul>
This is all simple arithmetic, just keep in mind the relationships between instruction count, CPI, cycle time, and clock rate. It's all 
basic arithmetic from there.

<h2>Common Performance Benchmarks</h2>
<h3>SPEC CPU Benchmark</h3>
The SPEC CPU benchmark is an industry standard program that is supposed to emulate a normal CPU workload by feeding a given processor 
a selection of programs to execute, measuring the execution time of a given processor, then normalizing that figure to a reference processor, 
or baseline. The ratios of the measured execution time to the reference can then be given as a geometric mean, which winds up giving us a 
nice, comprehendable number that we can associate with a processors performance.
<br></br>
The programs that the SPEC benchmark runs are designed to have negligable I/O, so they can more closely measure CPU execution time to make the 
benchmark more about the processor and less about its supporting cast.
<h3>SPEC Power Benchmark</h3>
The SPEC power benchmark is used to measure the power consumption of a server at different workload levels. It in essence measures the 
mean ssj_ops per Watt of power consumed. The higher this ratio is, the better a server's performance for any given Watt of energy it consumes. 
This is especially important for data center applications; while it is a giant up-front cost to construct a data center, the long term cost of 
the power necessary for a company to operate the datacenter is directly proportional to the amount of energy the machines in the center need to 
perform any given task they may encounter.

<h2>A Quick Note on <i>Amdahl's Law</i></h2>
Amdahl's law essentially carves into stone something that should be fairly obvious. Amdahl's Law essentially states that the overall performance 
improvement gained by improving a single part of a system is limited by the fraction of time that the improved part is actually used.
<br></br>
For example, if you make your file I/O operations take half as much time as previously, but you only are doing file I/O operations for 20% of the time it takes to run any 
given program, then in reality, you are not decreasing the overall execution time by half, but instead by about 11%. See the formula below for how to calculate this:
