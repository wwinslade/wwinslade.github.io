<h2>Premise</h2>
One of the more interesting classes I've taken at UT outside of my CS related classes was English 360: Technical and Professional Writing.
A welcomed change of pace from my other classes, this course centered around effectively creating technical writing, with the course cumulating
in the creation of a technical manual. The class was framed in the Battlestar Galactica (the good one, not the original) universe, and as such our
manuals were to be constructed in such a way as to fit into the universe. Topics of our manuals could be anything relevant, ranging from how to grow
sufficient food for the Colonial Fleet while underway in space to how to create effective education systems for the youth in the Colonial Fleet.
<br></br>
As an enthusiast of both spaceflight and a fan of the Battlestar Galactica series, the topic I came up with was how to rebuild the Galactica's air group. During the
series mini-series and the first few episodes of the main series, we witness tens of fighters being destroyed, but the topic of how to replace them to maintain
Galactica's combat effecitveness and training new pilots to replace casualties are never addressed in much detail, save for one of the senior pilots Starbuck 
attempting to train new pilots by herself without direction (as you can imagine, this didn't go so well).
