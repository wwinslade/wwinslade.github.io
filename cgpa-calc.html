UT has a 
<a href="https://registrar.utk.edu/diplomas/gpa-calculator/">tool</a>
 on their website that implements a GPA calculator.
The powers that be determined that 20 course fields would be sufficient
for figuring out your GPA, with no option to add more input fields. That sucks, and it requires an internet connection, so I wrote my own.
Beware, some institutions have different GPA scales than UT, so results may vary if you are not a UT student. I've included UT's
table here:

    <table align="center" border="3" cellpadding="10">
        <tr>
            <th>Grade</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A</td>
            <td>4.0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>A-</td>
            <td>3.7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>B+</td>
            <td>3.3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>B</td>
            <td>3.0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>B-</td>
            <td>2.7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C+</td>
            <td>2.3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C</td>
            <td>2.0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>C-</td>
            <td>1.7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>D+</td>
            <td>1.3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>D</td>
            <td>1.0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>D-</td>
            <td>0.7</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>F</td>
            <td>0.0</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

<h2>Usage</h2>
If you want to use this program you can download the source code <a href="https://github.com/wwinslade/WW-CGPA-Calc/tree/main">here</a>. Simply compile the source,
and call on the command line with:
<pre>./a.out grades_file.txt</pre>
The format of the text file you need to give it isn't strict. So long as for each course you are inputting, you list the hours, followed by a space, then grade you received in the class,
it'll work as intended. Grades are not case sensitive. The program prints your total hours, total grade points, and cumulative GPA to standard output in your shell environment.

For example, either of the below would work fine:
<table align="center" border="3" cellpadding="10">
    <tr>
        <th>example1.txt</th>
        <th>example2.txt</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            2 a <br>
            3 b <br>
            4 a <br>
            2 c+ <br>
        </td>
        <td>
            2 A 3 B 4 A 2 C+
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
